Programs & Communities
We provide intentional communities where residents engage in creating a supportive space. These housing options help uplift diverse student identities and offer an opportunity to be in community with one another through shared interests.
Living-Learning Programs
Mixed Gender & Gender Inclusive Housing
Substance Free Housing
Living-Learning Program
Living-Learning Programs (LLPs) are residential communities where students live together and connect over shared interests and academic goals. Students in LLPs interact with university faculty and staff and participate in social and educational activities outside of the classroom.
To foster a close-knit community, your roommate will likely be from the same LLP. Your program will let you know whether you can request to live with someone outside of your LLP.

Mixed Gender & Gender Inclusive Housing
Students in
mixed gender housing
live in a residence hall room with someone of the same sex or gender, but the room next door may be occupied by students of a different sex or gender. On traditional hall floors, community bathrooms are designated as male or female.
Students in
gender inclusive housing
in traditional residence halls share the same room (and a private bathroom), regardless of sex, gender, or gender identity. Students in gender inclusive housing in a semi-suite, suite, or apartment share the same bedroom, regardless of sex, gender, or gender identity. Gender inclusive semi-suites have a private bathroom. Suite and apartment bathroom designations are determined by residents.
You can indicate your single, mixed, or gender inclusive housing preference when completing your Residence Hall Housing and Dining Agreement. If you have questions about gender inclusive housing or need additional information, please contact Michelle McCubbin at

Substance Free Housing
Students choose substance-free housing for many reasons - to support academic achievement, for religious or cultural beliefs, for health and wellness needs, and more. It is important to understand your motivation for choosing this housing option in order to be fully invested in the community.
If you choose to live in the substance-free community, you have the:
Right to live in a space free from alcohol and illegal drugs
Right to be free from disturbances caused by others under the influence
Right and responsibility to participate in the community accountability process
Responsibility to keep your personal space free from alcohol and illegal drugs
Responsibility to not be present under the influence
Responsibility to hold your guests accountable for the community standards
Substance-free housing is available in select locations in all North Campus communities. One floor in Carroll, Elkton, Ellicott, Bel Air, and Chestertown Halls features substance-free housing.
You can indicate your interest in this housing option when completing your Residence Hall Housing and Dining Agreement. When making roommate requests, it is your responsibility to ensure all roommates agree and want to live in substance-free housing. If you have questions about substance free housing or need additional information, please contact Michelle McCubbin at
mmccubbi@umd.edu
