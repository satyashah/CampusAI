Application Deadlines
Students have different deadlines based on their
applicant type
and desired semester of entry. Review our application deadlines to determine when you should apply and when you can expect to receive a decision. We strongly encourage all students to apply by the early action deadline for priority consideration.
In order to receive a decision, applications must be complete. Applications are considered complete when the online application and all required documents have been submitted. All materials must be submitted electronically or postmarked by the appropriate deadline for consideration.
Students can track their application status through the
Terps Application Portal
It is the applicant's responsibility to confirm receipt of all required materials. It may take up to 10 business days for recently submitted materials to be listed as received.
